# Ariel Speakers

The Ariel speaker is a transmission line speaker based around the Scan-Speak D2905/9x00 drivers. 
This project is based off the [Nutshell Ariel 6c](http://nutshellhifi.com/Ariel.html) designed with laser cutters and CNC routers in mind.
All speaker dimensions are now [metric](Metric_2019.png).
